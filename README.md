## My process

- build html
- create css
- check and verify frequently with Firefox and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned
Learned more about aligning and absolute/relative positioning. You can not set this transparent background image as an css-background image for the body, because then you can not position it on top of page.

### Continued development

Learn more about positioning, especially centering within different elements (grid, flex, block...).
