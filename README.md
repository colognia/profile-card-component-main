## My process

- build html
- create css
- check and verify frequently with Firefox and its developer console
- consulting my own notes regarding usage of tags/options, consulting developers.mozilla.org and w3schools


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- editor: visual studio code

### What I learned
Learned more about aligning and absolute/relative positioning. Making the background bubbles responsive did not work, for the mobile view it does not match the sample design.

### Continued development

Learn more about positioning, especially centering within different elements (grid, flex, block...). Want to understand why the background bubbles are not responsive.

### Useful resources

developers.mozilla.org
w3schools
